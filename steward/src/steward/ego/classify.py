"""Category inference from measured geometry and colour, against the robot's shape priors.

A measured box can be smaller than the object (only part of it was in view) but rarely larger, so
an observed extent below the prototype costs little and one above it costs a lot. Whether the
object stands on the floor or on something raised separates furniture from tableware. The result
is a probability per category; the estimator accumulates these over observations.
